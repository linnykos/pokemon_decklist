TODO

- Fix card_cropper.sh so it skips the crop if there exists the image in cards/
- Add different icons (i.e., different pokeballs) for different types
- We'll still need a function to "clean" the pokemon 
  name for the pokemon database (i.e., remove GX and EX)
- Add the pokemon database. It will have pokemon name, evolution family, and previous
  evolution.
- Sort the pokemon in a meaningful order (i.e., basic first, and length of name ->
  alphabetical to break ties), as well as the trainers and energy
- Make the system allow user to point-and-click to fill in the desired locations of
  cards who don't have X_right and Y_center filled in already. This would update
  the csv
- We need a error-handling system for if 1) the set name doesn't exist, 2) the pokemon
  ID is not found when using decklist, 3) X_right and Y_center is out of bounds, 4)
  pokemon ID is not found when making the card database (or information is incorretly
  entered in the csv for the database)
- Add evolution bg to link all the pokemon in the same family (yellow bar underneath
  the pokeball)
- We need more tools to help populate card_db.csv. For example, it looks through all
  the raw images and populates the names (with blanks) in the appropriate places??
- The font installation bugs out on the first try when there's no internet?
- Certain cards need custom cropping (or at least different ones?) (i.e., Talonflame
  BREAK, and all the EVO ones such as Raticate EVO)
- Add data.R documentation
- Find a way to reliably test all my plotting functions
- Add documentation and update the readme to be informative, as well as the DESCRIPTION
  file
- .ordering_trainer and .ordering_energy might crash if there are no items, for example,
  or if there are no basic energies
- Need to teset .ordering_energy w/ a deck with more than one type of energy
- Generations has a Radiant Collection (RC). How is this represented in the export?
- Make pokeball (normal) look more white
- Check to see if deck has 60 cards
- maybe add yellow horizontal bars to separate pokemon, trainer and energy
